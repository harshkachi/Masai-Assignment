String:
Strings, which are widely used in Java programming, are a sequence of characters.

For example
String greeting = "Hello Web-16";

To find the strings length() method, which returns the number of characters contained in the string object.
Others methods are available like Concatenating , join, split, trim etc.

The String class is immutable, so that once it is created a String object cannot be changed. 
If there is a necessity to make a lot of modifications to Strings of characters, 
then you should use String Buffer & String Builder.

--------------------------------------------

StringBuilder and StringBuffer are classes used in JAVA to provide us with functionality of mutable Strings. 
StringBuffer provides us with strings that are safe to use with multiple threads 
but this added functionality also makes it slower. StringBuilder lacks thread safety 
but because it does not have this added functionality, it has faster implementation.

-----------------------------

If you want to represent any object as a string, toString() method comes into existence.
The toString() method returns the String representation of the object.
